# weather-app
Hi! My name is Josh. Welcome to my weather app. Using this website is pretty straight forward, just search a city you would like to know the weather of and it shall appear in current weather, and a five day forcast.

[Here is a link to my deployed website, check it out!](https://sand-ito.github.io/weather-app/)

While it is quite bear the user is still able to access the current weather of the city they look up with the five day forcast. I would like to add icons to each report to give a more visual representation. I would also like to make my history of cities searched more interactive. Mainly allowing the user to click the city button and reshow that weather forcast.

Thank you for taking your time to look at my code, and interface with my website. 

Have a nice day

-Joshua Livak
